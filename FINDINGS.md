# Warhammer 40,000 Space Marines Analysis Findings

This document contains the findings from our analysis of Space Marine units. Each section focuses on different aspects of unit performance and efficiency metrics.

## Wounds to Points Ratio Analysis

One of our key analyses examines the efficiency of units based on their wounds to points ratio. This metric helps identify which units provide the best durability per point cost.

### Methodology
- We calculate the ratio by dividing a unit's total wounds by its point cost
- Higher ratios indicate better durability per point spent
- Analysis focuses on units in the "other" category

### Key Findings

The analysis of wounds to points ratio reveals several interesting patterns:

1. **Most Efficient Units**
   - Invader ATV: 0.114 wounds per point
   - Ballistus Dreadnought: 0.086 wounds per point
   - Gladiator Reaper: 0.080 wounds per point

2. **Least Efficient Units**
   - Incursor Squad: 0.025 wounds per point
   - Aggressor Squad: 0.025 wounds per point
   - Bladeguard Veteran Squad: 0.030 wounds per point

### Analysis Insights

1. **Vehicle Efficiency**
   - Vehicles generally show better wounds to points ratios
   - The Invader ATV stands out as the most efficient unit in terms of durability per point
   - Dreadnought variants show consistent efficiency, with ratios ranging from 0.057 to 0.086

2. **Infantry Units**
   - Infantry units typically have lower wounds to points ratios
   - This reflects their role as more specialized units rather than durability-focused
   - Elite units like Bladeguard Veterans show particularly low ratios, indicating their value lies in other aspects (weapons, abilities) rather than raw durability

3. **Strategic Implications**
   - For players prioritizing durability per point, vehicles offer better value
   - Infantry units should be evaluated based on their specialized roles rather than raw durability
   - The Invader ATV represents an excellent choice for players seeking efficient durability

### Technical Implementation

The analysis is implemented in `functions/wounds_points_ratio.py`, which provides:
- Automated calculation of wounds to points ratios
- Support for different unit data structures
- Sorting and comparison of unit efficiency
- Error handling for missing or malformed data

## Survivability per Point Analysis

This analysis builds upon our wounds-to-points ratio by incorporating toughness values to create a more comprehensive measure of unit durability.

### Methodology
- Base calculation: (Wounds ร Toughness Modifier) รท Points
- Toughness Modifier scale (based on wound roll probability):
  - T4 baseline (1.0 modifier)
  - Each point of T above 4 adds 0.167 to modifier (harder to wound)
  - Each point of T below 4 subtracts 0.167 from modifier (easier to wound)
